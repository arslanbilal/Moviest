### Project Structure (MVVM+Redux)
From [redux.js.org](http://www.redux.js.org): `Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.`

The application use store. In this store, you have your application state. From your views, you send actions to the store and reducers execute these actions. As state is changed by reducers, store notifies the view so that it can reflect changes on UI.

##### Core benefits:
- It encourages you to find the real state of your app and model every change and action. This makes everything easy to understand.
- Maximises separation of concerns. Every component does only one job.
- Improves testability. Reducers has pure functions that are really easy to test.
- Store propagates state automatically. (So you donâ€™t have to choose between delegation, blocks, notifications or KVO.)
